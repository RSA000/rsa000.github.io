<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>Chinese cooking in recent years has become very popular in America, and
certain Japanese dishes are also in high favor. The restaurants are no
longer merely the resort of curious idlers, intent upon studying types
peculiar to Chinatown, for the Chinese restaurants have pushed their way
out of Chinatown and are now found in all parts of the large cities of
America. In New York they rub elbows with and challenge competition with
the finest eating palaces. Their patronage to-day is of the very best,
and many of their dishes are justly famous.</p>

<p>There is no reason why these same dishes should not be cooked and served
in any American home. When it is known how simple and clean are the
ingredients used to make up these Oriental dishes, the Westerner will
cease to feel that natural repugnance which assails one when about to
taste a strange dish of a new and strange land.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Bread, butter, and potatoes are never used by the Chinese or Japanese.
Tea is drunk plain, with neither cream nor sugar, but great care should
be used in its brewing. Rice is indispensable, and should be cooked in
that peculiarly delectable fashion of which the Oriental peoples alone
are past masters. The secret of the solid, flaky, almost dry, yet
thoroughly cooked rice lies in the fact that it is never boiled more
than thirty minutes, is covered twenty minutes, never stirred nor
disturbed, and set to dry on back of range when cooked, covered with a
cloth. Mushy, wet, slimy, overcooked rice is unknown to the Chinese and
Japanese. Sweetened rice, as in rice pudding and similar dishes, is
unknown. Rice takes the place of such staples as bread and potatoes.
Syou, sometimes called Soye, is similar to Worcestershire and similar
European sauces. In fact, the latter are all said to be adaptations of
the original Chinese syou, and most of these European sauces contain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
syou in their makeup. It lends a flavor to any meat dish, and is greatly
esteemed by the Oriental peoples.</p>

<p>In China, with the exception of rice, bonbons, and so on, food is served
in one large dish or bowl, out of which all eat, using the chopsticks.
Considerable etiquette governs the manner of picking desired morsels
from the main bowls. In high-caste or mandarin families a servant has
his place at the foot of the table, but he stands throughout the meal.
It is his duty to serve at the table the portions from the main dishes
to each individual, and to do what the host generally does for the
comfort of those at table. The other servants waiting on table take
their orders from him, and he is really there as a sort of proxy for the
host.</p>

<p>In Japan, individual meals are brought in on separate trays to each
person. All sit cross-legged upon the floor before their trays. The
Japanese consider it gross and vulgar to put <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> food in quantity upon
the plate. The portions are very small, the largest being about the size
of an egg. There is a striving for daintiness and simplicity.</p>

<p>For this book only such Chinese and Japanese dishes have been selected
as would appeal to the Western palate, and which can be prepared with
the kitchen utensils of Western civilization. Many dishes prepared by
the Chinese cooks in this country are only modifications of their native
dishes. Recipes for the same dish, obtained from different parts of
China, vary considerably. The combinations here given are those which
experience has proved most easily prepared and most palatable.</p>

<p>The authors advise any one who intends to cook "Chinese" to go to some
Chinese restaurant and taste the various dishes he desires to cook. A
good cook always should know what a dish tastes like before he tries to
cook it. All cooks can tell how the taste of a strange dish reveals to
him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
many things, and it is often possible to guess of what the dish is
composed.</p>

<p>No cookbooks, so far as the authors know, have ever been published in
China. Recipes descend like heirlooms from one generation of cooks to
another. The recipes included in this book (the Chinese ones, that is)
have been handed down from Vo Ling, a worthy descendant of a long line
of noted Chinese cooks, and himself head cook to Gow Gai, one time
highest mandarin of Shanghai. They are all genuine, and were given as an
especial expression of respect by a near relative of the famous family
of Chinese cooks.</p>

<h2>CHINESE RECIPES</h2>

<hr style="width: 95%;" />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

<h3>RULES FOR COOKING</h3>


<h4>GENERAL</h4>

<p>The first and the most important rule for Chinese cooking is
cleanliness, first of the hands, second of the utensils, and third of
the food.</p>

<p>Meat should not be washed, but should be rinsed in cold or lukewarm
water and, if necessary, singed over a hot flame and scraped with a
sharp knife.</p>

<p>All vegetables and fruit should be washed in cold water,&mdash;if
necessary, in fifty different waters.</p>

<p>Never use soap to wash saucepans. Use washing soda or sand.</p>

<p>All cloths and dish towels should be boiled and rinsed thoroughly.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to measure accurately the ingredients of recipes, for
the spices and relishes used in Chinese kitchens are exceedingly hot and
pronounced in flavor.</p>

<p>To make rich stock for soup use <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> only a quart of water to every pound of veal,
mutton, or beef bone.</p>

<p>To determine whether a fish is fresh, watch that its flesh is firm and
thick, its scales glistening, and its eyes prominent.</p>

<p>When dropped into a bowl or pan containing cold water, eggs that are
absolutely fresh will immediately sink to the bottom and rest there;
eggs which are not perfectly fresh will stand on end or rise a little.</p>

<p>Delicious dishes can be obtained only from the use of the purest and
best quality of ingredients. A good cook needs to be as well a
discriminating purchaser.</p>

<p>Glass measures recording pints and quarts of liquid and ounces and
pounds of solids (like sugar), with the fractions thereof, are handy and
sanitary.</p>


<br />
<h4>TO BOIL RICE</h4>

<p>Use an iron pot. Wash the rice thoroughly in many waters, until, in
fact, the water is as clear as for drinking. To one cupful of rice
add<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one and a quarter cupfuls of cold water. Cover tight, and boil slowly
half an hour&mdash;no more. On no account stir. Rice should not be
disturbed till it is taken up; that is the secret of the dry, finely
cooked Chinese rice. Set on back of range, covered with a clean cloth or
napkin, until ready to serve. Rice should be served in individual bowls,
replenished as soon as empty throughout the meal. With the Chinese it
takes the place of bread or potatoes. Salt is not added until it is
served.</p>


<br />
<h4>TEA</h4>

<p>The quantity of tea used depends on the quality, and the taste of the
individual. Rinse the pot with boiling water before putting in the tea.
The water should just come to a boil&mdash;no more. Pour on the tea
leaves. Let it stand for two or three minutes, but on no account must it
be allowed to boil. Strain tea from leaves, and serve pure, if Chinese
tea is used. See more about tea on page 109.</p>



<a name="SOUPS" id="SOUPS"></a>
<hr style="width: 95%;" />

<h3>SOUPS</h3>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

<h4>YEA FOO MAIN</h4>

<p>One quart of soup stock; one quarter pound of mushrooms; three stalks of
celery; one eighth clove of garlic; six water chestnuts; one quarter
pound of vermicelli; one and one quarter teaspoonfuls of salt; one
teaspoonful of syou (Chinese sauce).</p>

<p>Have the soup stock boiling hot. Then wash thoroughly in cold water all
the above vegetables, and cut in small pieces. Add to the soup one
tablespoonful of syou, and the salt and pepper. Let all boil twenty
minutes; then add the vermicelli and boil fifteen minutes more. Serve
with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters.</p>


<br />
<h4>YAT KO MAIN</h4>

<p>One quart of soup stock; one quarter pound of noodles; one and one half
teaspoonfuls of salt; one quarter pound of minced ham; one table
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
spoonful of syou; one small onion; one stalk of celery.</p>

<p>Boil the noodles until tender&mdash;about ten minutes. Then remove from
the hot water, and put in cold water to soak, while preparing the soup.
To one quart of good soup stock add one onion and one stalk of celery,
chopped fine, pepper and salt, and one tablespoonful of syou. Boil ten
minutes. Remove noodles from the cold water, add them to the soup, and
boil for five minutes more. The ham should be shredded. Just before
serving sprinkle it on top.</p>


<br />
<h4>SOUP STOCK</h4>

<p>Save all beef, veal, and chicken bones and clean pieces of meat; also
the feet of chickens and the giblets. Wash the chicken feet and skin
them, by first scalding in boiling water. Cover all the above with cold
water and let it boil from five to eight hours slowly, with salt to
taste. Drain liquor from bones, and set away to <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> cool. When cold it
will be a thick jelly, and is used as the foundation for various soups
and gravies.</p>


<br />
<h4>MO KU GAI T'ONG<br />
(Spring Chicken Soup with Mushrooms)</h4>

<p>Two and one half pounds of chicken; one quarter pound of lean pork; one
quarter pound of dried mushrooms; one dozen lotus seeds; three stalks of
celery; one teaspoonful of salt; one tablespoonful of syou; one onion.</p>

<p>Clean a fresh young chicken of about two and one half pounds. Cut off
all the flesh; put the bones, with liver and gizzard, into three pints
of cold water, and boil for two hours, adding water if it boils away.
While the stock is boiling, prepare the following: Cut up the chicken
meat into small pieces. Cut up very fine one quarter pound of lean pork.
Wash and soak in lukewarm water one quarter pound of dried mushrooms.
Pull off all the stalks. Peel and cut a dozen lotus seeds or water
chestnuts. Chop three stalks of celery <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> very fine, and also one
onion. Pour off the liquor from the bones, and strain. Cut up liver and
gizzard fine and return to stock. Add all the ingredients, with one
teaspoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of syou. Boil all together for
one hour.</p>


<br />
<h4>GAI GRUN YUNG WAA<br />
(Bird's-nest Soup)</h4>

<p>One half pound of bird's nest; one pint of chicken stock; one quarter
pound of cooked breast of chicken; one boiled egg; one quarter pound of
minced ham; one teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>To make this soup, the bird's nest is first boiled an hour, then drained
and put into cold water. Meanwhile the cooked chicken meat is well
pounded, so as not to be in large or hard pieces, and a cupful of the
cold stock is added to it. Next the bird's nest is taken from the cold
water and well drained, and added to the soup stock. Boil for half an
hour. Now the chicken meat is added, and also the egg, the latter having
previously been finely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
crumbled. The soup is taken off the fire as it begins to boil again
after the last addition. Before serving, the minced ham is sprinkled on
top.</p>

<p>Bird's nest is a gelatinous substance, a species of seaweed, with which
certain Chinese birds, the esculent swallow and the white-backed
swallow, build their nests. It is also found in Java. It is one of the
most delicious of Chinese foods, and esteemed and praised not alone by
the Chinese but by all travelers in the Orient.</p>


<br />
<h4>SEAWEED SOUP</h4>

<p>Two yolks of hard-boiled eggs; one can of seaweed; three chicken
giblets; two tablespoonfuls of syou; one and one half teaspoonfuls of
Quong Sang Chong (water chestnut flour).</p>

<p>Boil one can of seaweed until it is like thin jelly. Have ready three
chicken giblets, chopped very fine, having first boiled them one hour in
a quart of water. Add the seaweed, and boil all together for half an
hour. Strain, then crumble in the yolks of <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> two hard-boiled eggs,
stir in two tablespoonfuls of syou, and salt to taste. Rub smooth one
and a half teaspoonfuls of Quong Sang Chong in a little cold water, then
add to the soup and stir until it thickens slightly. Serve with a small
piece of seaweed on top that has been soaking in spiced vinegar.</p>


<br />
<h4>B&Auml;K TOY GUN<br />
(Chinese Soup of White Vegetables)</h4>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of syou; one half pound of white mushrooms; one dozen
water chestnuts; one quarter pound of bean sprouts; one stalk of celery;
two small onions; three eggs; bit of garlic.</p>

<p>No meat or stock is used for this soup. Have ready three pints of
boiling, salted water, with the two tablespoonfuls of syou in it. Add
all of above vegetables (which have been previously washed in cold
water, and cut in small pieces) except the mushrooms and celery. Boil
for fifteen minutes, then add the mush<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>rooms and celery. Whip up
the three eggs in a little cold water, and drop slowly into the boiling
soup, stirring the soup as it drops, and it will form into fanciful
shapes. Remove at once, and serve.</p>




<a name="GRAVY" id="GRAVY"></a>
<hr style="width: 95%;" />

<h3>GRAVY</h3>
<span class='pagenum'> <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>

<p>Use pork fat cut up and fried crisp. Then rub smooth one tablespoonful
of Quong Sang Chong (water-chestnut flour) or rice flour in cold water,
and stir it slowly into the boiling fat until it thickens and browns.
Add syou, salt, pepper, and a little sugar. In preparing chop sueys and
similar dishes, use this gravy if the mixture is too dry.</p>


<br />
<h4>GRAVY WITH ONIONS</h4>

<p>Place two tablespoonfuls of chicken fat or pork fat in pan, and when it
is very hot add a finely chopped onion and fry a golden brown. Now
slowly stir in one tablespoonful of flour until brown (taking care not
to burn), salt, pepper, and a little sugar, then slowly pour boiling
water, stirring all the time, until you have a smooth, rich gravy. Use
for addition to the various dishes.</p>




<a name="FISH" id="FISH"></a>
<hr style="width: 95%;" />

<h3>FISH</h3>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

<h4>TEN SUNE GUNE<br />
(Sweet and Sour Fish)</h4>

<p>Two pounds of sea bass; one and one half cupfuls of water; one
tablespoonful of Quong Sang Chong (water-chestnut flour); two and one
half tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>Clean a sea bass of about two pounds. Take out all the insides, taking
care to keep the fish whole. Then put it into a medium deep dish large
enough to fit the fish. Pour over it water almost boiling, cover fish
well over. Put a lid on dish, and leave on range for one hour. Do not
boil, but keep it hot. Now prepare the following sauce: Rub smooth one
tablespoonful of Quong Sang Chong. To a cup and a half of water add one
tablespoonful of salt, one and one half tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two
and one half tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Mix well. Boil until it
thickens, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stirring constantly to prevent burning. Dish up the fish, place on
another hot, dry dish, then pour over it the sauce, and serve with rice.</p>


<br />
<h4>PINEAPPLE FISH</h4>

<p>Two pounds of fish; one tablespoonful of syou; one can of preserved
pineapple.</p>

<p>Clean a haddock or codfish of about two pounds and take out the bones.

<p>One small chicken; one medium-sized carrot; one pint of satorius
(elephant-ear plant); two white radishes; one quarter pound of dried
mushrooms; one quarter pound of aburage (oil-fried Tofu); one quarter
pound of miso paste (soy bean and rice cheese); one half teaspoonful of
mixed red-pepper spices.</p>

<p>To prepare the chicken, separate the meat from the bones; then put bones
in cold water and boil slowly for about two hours. Strain, and add the
well-chopped vegetables. (The mushrooms should have been washed, and
soaked in lukewarm water for ten minutes previously.) Boil for one more
hour, then add the chicken meat, cut in very small pieces, salt, spices,
and half a teaspoonful of sugar. Cook all slowly for one hour. This
makes about three pints of soup. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72"
id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> is better to make it the day before it is to
be used. Soup is always improved by standing over night. The late Mikado
took three or four sips of this soup for breakfast.</p>

<p>Thoroughly clean and singe the chicken, and scald feet to peel off scabs
or skin. Cut giblets in small pieces and the chicken in about six
pieces, and cover with three quarts of cold water. Boil all for about
three hours, according to the age of the chicken. While it is boiling
wash and cut up the vegetables. Now make the egg noodles of flour and
eggs and roll as thin as paper on a floured board, then cut in shapes of
flowers (chrysanthemums, the Japanese prefer), and <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> leave spread out on the
board to dry. Drain all soup from the bones and bring to a boil. Add
vegetables, salt, pepper, and one teaspoonful of sugar; also the syou
sauce. Boil all for half an hour, then throw in the noodles and cook for
ten minutes. Serve each bowl of soup with one large noodle flower on
top.</p>

syou sauce; one cupful of cooking juice sauce; one small carrot; two
onions; three hard-boiled eggs; two tablespoonfuls of cooked, chopped
ham; pepper, salt, sugar, and spices.</p>

<p>To make this soup, any fish of the milder variety can be used, such as
cod, haddock, or bass; lobster and shrimps are also good cooked this
way. Have the pork cut into small pieces, and fry a golden brown; then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wash the fish and take out all bones, chop up into small pieces, add to

pound of fat fresh pork; one dozen red plums; one small lime or lemon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a small hare or large rabbit that has been hanging for at least two
days, and after it has been skinned, and the insides removed, wash well
in cold water. Cut in quarters and put in a deep dish, covering it well
with the vinegar, sugar, salt, and so on, mixed with water. Add the

<h4>UNOHANA YAKI<br />
(Flower Custard)</h4>

<p>Two ounces of Kanton (Japanese gelatine); six eggs; three tablespoonfuls
of cherry sirup; one ounce of goma seeds.</p>

<p>To make the pink custards, whip the whites of five eggs into the
dissolved two ounces of gelatine. Add, while stirring over a slow fire,
three tablespoonfuls of cherry sirup. Let it come to a boil, then pour
quickly into flower-shaped molds, and let it set.</p>

<p>Yellow custards can be made by using the yolks instead of the whites of
eggs, and half a pint of coconut milk. When the custards are solid, turn
them from the molds on to large leaves on a plate, or decorate the
flowered custard with leaves suitable to the flower represented. If the
flower has a dark center, use goma seeds, and if variegated colors are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
liked, pour half the yellow and half the cherry custards into the molds.
The effect is very pretty, and the custards delicious. The pouring
should be done very quickly and lightly, and the molds, of course,
should be of flower designs. All travelers are enthusiasts on the
subject of Japanese flower custards.</p>

and three tablespoonfuls of cherry sirup. Throw a handful of ripe, plump
red cherries into the baking pan, and over this pour the above mixture.
Bake for about half an hour in a medium oven. Then remove, and at
intervals over top of dish set more cherries. Sugar is unnecessary where
the cherries are sweet and ripe, as the sirup will then suffice.</p>


<br />
<h4>TAMAGO BOLAN<br />
(Peony Eggs)</h4>

<p>Boil five eggs hard. Place in cold water. Remove shells carefully, so as
not to blemish whites. Carefully cut off top with thread, one end

Remove the yolks. Boil a small pink snapper (fish) in hot water for ten
minutes, or steam for thirty. Remove all bones and fins, and chop
together until fine. Mix with finely mashed miso, pepper, and salt. Chop
yolks daintily and fluffily, and mix with fish meat. Fill the whites
with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
this mixture. Now place the filled whites in center of a lettuce head
and arrange fine strips of udo shoots round it. To fix lettuce head
properly, all the leaves should be carefully adjusted and separated,
washed, and then put back into shape again. It looks now like a bouquet,
and is held together with toothpicks.</p>

<h4>KATAMOCHI</h4>

<p>This cracker comes ready prepared in boxes, and is good to serve with
soups, oysters, etc. For those who wish to make it, the following recipe
is given: Moisten the rice flour and allow it to rise of itself over
night, no yeast or baking powder being used. Add salt, and roll into
thin crackers. The process is precisely the same as the Jewish Matzoth
cracker, and there appears to be a similarity also in the names, which
has caused students often to point to it as another interesting evidence
that the Japanese people are of Semitic origin&mdash;perhaps the "lost
tribe"!</p>


<br />
<h4>YOMOGA GA SHIMA</h4>

<p>This crisp little Japanese cake also comes prepared in boxes. It
acquired fame through its being the favorite cake of the late Mikado.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>To make it, boil to a paste fresh or dried (previously soaked) lima
beans. When they are cooked, set them aside to cool and thoroughly dry,
then pound them to a fine flour. Roll on a floured board into thin
crackers, and bake in a hot oven till crisp. They can be sweet or not,
as desired.</p>

<p>Lily-root candy can be bought at almost any Chinese store. It has the
consistency of very stiff gumdrops, and one variety, called Chicken
Neck, is peppered over with red seeds.</p>


<br />
<h4>SAN CHAR GO</h4>

<p>A favorite Chinese candy, made from red Chinese dates.</p>

<p>The fruit is first mashed to a pulp, then mixed with powdered sugar and
gelatine, beaten into a paste, rolled in sheets as thin as paper, and
spread in the sun to dry. After it has dried crisp, it is cut into
squares of six by four inches, wrapped in waxed paper, and packed in
bundles. It has a delightfully piquant flavor, tart and sweet.</p>


<br />
<h4>OWA OKASHI</h4>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

<p>A favorite Japanese candy. It is made of sweet rice, roasted over an
open fire, same as popcorn, mixed with goma seeds, and held together in
pressed bars with barley sugar. It is an improvement over the American
popcorn-peanut balls.</p>


<br />
<h4>YOHAN CANDY</h4>

<p>Boil adzuki (purple beans) to a paste, and mix with sugar and seaweed
gelatine. Allow it to harden.</p>


<br />
<h4>CHESTNUT KINTONS<br />
(Cream Candy)</h4>

<p>One quart of chestnuts; one pint of sweet potatoes; one pound of sugar;
three quarters pint of mirin sauce; one tablespoonful of vinegar.</p>

<p>Blanch the chestnuts and place them in lukewarm water. Boil, changing
water several times, until you can pierce the nuts with a needle. Strain
off water, then add one pound of sugar, three quarters of a pint of
mirin sauce, and boil slowly. Have ready sweet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
potatoes which have been peeled and boiled for twenty minutes. Add to
them the vinegar, and strain and press through sieve. Gradually mix with
the chestnuts, and slowly boil, stirring constantly, until dry; then
mold into desired shapes. Roll in powdered sugar.</p>

<p>This might be called the Japanese Fudge.</p>


<br />
<h4>DAI-K&#256;M<br />
(Orange Jelly Candy)</h4>

<p>One half pound of Kanton (seaweed jelly); three quarters pound of fine
white sugar; three tablespoonfuls of kudzu starch; two oranges.</p>

<p>Wash half a pound of dry seaweed jelly, and soak it for two and a half
hours in cold water. Then squeeze out all the water and break in small
pieces. Boil in about a quart of water, until well melted, then mix
three quarters of a pound of sugar with this, stirring with chopsticks
or wooden spoon. Strain into another pan, and boil over medium fire.
Take three tablespoon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>fuls of kudzu starch and dissolve in a
little cold water. Then, drop by drop, gradually drop this into the
jelly, while stirring with wooden spoon. When it becomes transparent,
squeeze in the juice of two oranges and immediately remove from fire.
Pour into a wooden box, and set in cool place for two hours to harden.</p>


<br />
<h4>SWEET POTATO CANDY</h4>

<p>This is loved by Japanese children, and is easily made. Boil sweet
potatoes, mash and roll them into little balls, then toss into boiling
sirup. Let them brown. Take out, and set to cool and become brittle.</p>


<br />
<h4>RICE AND NUT CANDIES</h4>

<p>These come in a great variety of ways. They are made chiefly of boiled
rice pressed into balls with chopped nuts, tossed into boiling sirup,
and then allowed to cool and harden. Seeds are often added, but these
cannot be obtained in America.</p>

<h3>BEAN SPROUTS AND<br />
BEVERAGES</h3>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

<h4>HOW TO PREPARE BEAN SPROUTS</h4>

<p>These come in cans, but it is better to make them fresh at home, and it
is easily done.</p>

<p>Take ordinary white beans, or dried lima beans, and soak over night in
lukewarm water. In the morning take a large cloth, wet it, and set it on
a table. Over this spread the beans. The cloth must be kept wet. In a
night or two the beans will have sprouted. Use the sprouts as directed
in the chop suey recipes.</p>


<br />
<h4>BEVERAGES</h4>

<p>Tea, of course, is the staple drink of both the Chinese and the
Japanese, and it comes in any number of varieties. Of the Chinese teas a
few may be especially recommended, such as Loong Taing, Long Gue,
Oolong, and Lung Sue. Of the Japanese teas, Gyukura, or, in English,
Pearl Dews, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tea is delicious. Coconut milk with flower petals floating in it is
another favorite beverage. Chinese whisky and wine are very strong, and
have a smoky flavor much appreciated by the epicure. Sak&eacute;, famous
as chief drink of the Japanese, is a sort of rice wine, with a curious
salty-sweet taste to it. It is very good, when once one becomes
accustomed to it.</p>
